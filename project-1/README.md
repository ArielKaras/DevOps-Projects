# User-IP-Viewer

User-IP-Viewer is a web application built with React and Node.js that retrieves and displays the user's IP address. This repository demonstrates how to containerize the application using Docker and deploy it to AWS using Terraform and GitHub Actions.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- AWS account
- Terraform
- Basic understanding of AWS services (ECR, ECS, ALB)

## Setup

### Fork and Clone the Repository

1. Fork the repository by clicking the "Fork" button on the top right corner.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-url>`.

### Configure AWS Credentials

1. Set up your AWS credentials on your local machine using the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).
2. Configure GitHub Actions with your AWS credentials as [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets).

### Deploy the Application

1. Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform working directory.
2. Run `terraform apply` to deploy the infrastructure to AWS.
3. Trigger the GitHub Actions workflow to build and push the Docker images to ECR.

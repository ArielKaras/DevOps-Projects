## Projects

### [Project-1: User-IP-Viewer](./Project-1)

User-IP-Viewer is a web application built with React and Node.js that retrieves and displays the user's IP address. This project covers DevOps concepts and tools such as Dockerfiles for containerization, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, Terraform for infrastructure as code, and AWS services like ECR for container registry and EKS for container orchestration. It demonstrates how to integrate these tools to create an efficient, automated, and scalable deployment pipeline for web applications.

### [Project-2: GoalZone](./Project-2)

GoalZone is a soccer website that provides real-time updates on daily games, live notifications, user profiles, and search functionality for finding specific leagues. The application is built using Python, Flask, and a responsive design optimized for desktop. This project showcases various DevOps tools and practices, such as Docker for containerization, Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment, DynamoDB for data storage, Kubernetes for container orchestration, and Snyk for security monitoring. GoalZone demonstrates how to effectively build, manage, and deploy a modern web application using cloud computing and DevOps principles.

### [Project-3: IoT-DevOps Integration](./Project-3)

Project-3 explores the integration of IoT and DevOps by creating an IoT application that leverages C++, ROS (Robot Operating System), and Linux for development. This project demonstrates the use of CI/CD pipelines to automate building, testing, and deployment of IoT systems. With Terraform for infrastructure as code and Amazon Web Services (AWS) for cloud-based resources, it showcases a modern approach to managing IoT deployments at scale. The project also includes electronic diagrams to illustrate the hardware components and their connections, highlighting the synergy between IoT, DevOps, and electronics engineering for efficient and scalable IoT solutions.
